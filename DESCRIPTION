Description: The package provides functions for large scale, high-dimensional logistic regression analysis
    both with the entire data set or with data split across multiple cores for faster computation. The function
    uses some regularization in the list of LASSO, MCP or SCAD to tackle with high-dimensionality of the data, and
    will produce a sparse prediction with an active set specifying the predicted non-zero entries. The method for 
    determining the combined active set is majority voting, and there are three different methods for aggregating 
    the final estimates.
